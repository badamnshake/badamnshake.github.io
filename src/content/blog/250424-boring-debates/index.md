# I : Language

I remember when studying Gujarati or English, writing essays (or an essay) was part of the exam **but** not the curriculum. It was never formally taught how to actually write or what constitutes sensibly written work. The basics, such as sentence structure or correct grammar, were there. But how to actually write, that was never taught. It was assumed by the teacher that the **13 year-old** had everything at their disposal to write something that made sense.  
\
The rubric for judging your essay was never fully transparent. I do not mean "mathematics" transparent, it was never there. However, the topics or titles of the essays that would be asked in the question were specified. The teacher always judged the essay based on how beautiful your handwriting was and/or how much of it was directly copied from existing material. The question was always something that was existed/pre-written the textbook.  I do not have a **grudge** against the marking system, considering the very subjective nature of language. It would’ve helped if we got constructive feedback along with our marks. People just assumed that language works this way, The authorities voice is the final voice.

# II : Debates

Fast forward to debates. There was always a sense of a winning party in any kind of argument at school. If something escalated to the point where a teacher got involved, they had to have a correct answer, and their judgment would be final.  
\
This setting imposed a way of thinking where there was always a correct answer and a correct way to do anything.   It killed the sense of curiosity, limiting it to an extent where it only lasted until there was an answer in front of you, satisfactory to a degree. After that, curiosity became useless. This made me search for the most optimum ways to do things or things that led to answers quickly. This is a polarizing behaviour or marks the point where polarizing behaviour is instilled.  
\
It led to a point where the whole purpose of studying became preparing for exams. In exams, you either know an answer or you don’t. You prepare for it the whole school year so you know the right answer, which is a simple process and rewards you easily. Polar opposite of anything you need to do to actually learn.


# III : Polarization

In my life, me and my friends, being a product of this system,  In a situation where an argument is concerned, it boils down to two scenarios.

#### 1. The authority is present

In this case, someone who holds some status is automatically deemed right. Whether it is someone who is rich, a saint, or older and more experienced. Whatever they say is final, and arguing with them gets you nowhere.

#### 2. You have to take a side and fight until the end

In this case, polarization happens, where the dilemma is simplified into two terms, either this or that. You have to pick one side and fight for it, even if you do not believe in it. This is the outcome of the system that was in place. You could either be right or wrong; there is nothing in the middle.  
For many arguments, however, picking a side means going to extremes, and going to extremes means you don’t even believe in whatever is being put forward.
\
Often, I find myself getting into these situations, which is quite frustrating and I think it is a side effect of the upbringing.
